PPIs were imported from data/interim/10292-local/ppi_data/10292-ppi-merged.tsv

TaxonIDs were read from data/interim/10292-local/taxonid/10292-child-taxids.txt and data/interim/10292-local/taxonid/interacting-taxids.txt

All intra-species and intra-pathogen interactions were omitted.
26273 unique identifiers in column xref_A did not conform to the PSI-MITAB format (multiple identifiers were present) and a fix was attempted.

26273 unique identifiers in column xref_B did not conform to the PSI-MITAB format (multiple identifiers were present) and a fix was attempted.

By removing/fixing protein identifiers that consisted of multiple entries, the following duplicates were introduced in the dataset:

661 identifiers were remapped to multiple UniProt accession numbers (denoted by the prefix "MULT_MAP" in the dataset) for a total of 1931 interactions.

Omitted 1931 PPIs due to the existance of multiple mappings.

The act of remapping protein identifiers to UniProt AC, introduced the following duplicates:
